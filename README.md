<p>Search Engine Optimization - SEO - YouTube and Google - how best to set search algorithms.</p>

<h2>Try <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about">Google Search Console (GSC)</a></h2>
<p>What it is: Search Console is a free search optimization tool from Google.</p>

<p>Broadly, most website optimization tools fall into six main categories:</p>
<h3><ol type="1">
  <li>Page speed</li>
  <li>Search engine optimization (SEO)</li>
  <li>User experience (UX)</li>
  <li>Conversion rate optimization (CRO)</li>
  <li>Mobile-first</li>
  <li>Accessibility</li>
</ol></h3>

<h2>1. Web page speed tools</h2>
A slow website can drive users away and hurt search rankings. Web page speed tools aren‚Äôt going to fix your slow site on their own, but they will measure page speed and show you what‚Äôs slowing it down. You‚Äôll be able to pinpoint how to improve page load times by following recommendations like

	- <h3>Reducing and compressing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images</h3>

	- <h3>Caching content</h3>

	- <h3>Using faster-hosting servers</h3>

	- <h3>Pingdom</h3>

	- <h3>WebPageTest</h3>

	- <h3>Lighthouse</h3>

<h2>2. Search engine optimization (SEO)</h2>

SEO helps you get more free website traffic from search engines like Google and Bing. There are many website optimization tools in the SEO category that help you optimize your site structure, keywords, and rankings. These include

Technical SEO tools to audit on-page SEO (like checking meta robots tags or 404 links)

Keyword research tools to find keyword ideas

Rank tracking tools to measure and compare search traffic, and tell you how your site ranks in the search engine results pages (SERPs) for target keywords

Content optimization tools to optimize for target keywords

Backlink analysis tools to check which pages link to your site (or to competitors)

Video SEO tools to optimize your videos to rank highly on video search engines like YouTube

You can use specialist SEO tools that only do one thing (for example, Screaming Frog is a dedicated technical SEO tool), and all-in-one SEO tools, like Ahrefs, which do a little of everything.

3. UX optimization tools
Great UX reduces friction and keeps visitors engaged. Many website optimization tools are designed specifically to track, analyze, and improve user behavior across your site.

UX optimization tools won't magically improve your user experience, but usability testing will help you understand user behavior and diagnose problems so you can optimize pages and give people what they need to keep browsing and buying from your site.

UX tools help with each step of the website and page optimization journey, from spotting where users get stuck to conducting user research.

4. CRO tools
When done right, CRO increases the number of website visitors who become customers (or perform any desired action on your site).

There‚Äôs no single tool that improves conversion rate but with a combination of

Traditional analytics (tools like Google Analytics or the product analytics features in Contentsquare)

Behavior analytics software (tools like Contentsquare‚Äôs Heatmaps, Session Replays, and Surveys)

Testing tools (like Omniconvert)

Conversion rate is key to business success, and website optimization tools in this category help you understand what encourages users to act‚Äîand what doesn‚Äôt. By combining behavioral analytics with A/B testing, these tools help you refine your pages until they convert more consistently.

üì¢ Pro tip: If you‚Äôre looking to boost your conversion rate, Contentsquare‚Äôs suite of tools combines quantitative data (what‚Äôs my conversion rate on this page?) and quantitative data (how are users behaving on this page in the moments before conversion?).

For example, you could: 

Use dashboards to monitor your conversion data. If you see that the conversions for a particular page have dropped, you might click through to watch session replays of users interacting with that page. If something on the page has changed‚Äîa UX issue has cropped up or a link has broken‚Äîyou‚Äôll be able to spot it immediately, fix it, and watch your conversion rate return to normal.   

Use Journey Analysis to see the paths users usually take to conversion and the pages they‚Äôre most likely to drop off of. This helps you identify the points in the customer journey that seem to be putting users off their conversion goals. If there‚Äôs a page with a particularly high drop-off rate, for example, you can click through to watch session replays of how users behave on it. You might discover they‚Äôre getting stuck with a broken CTA or confusing information‚Äîin other words, you may find that there‚Äôs a simple design fix that would boost your conversions.


5. Mobile optimization tools
More people browse websites on mobile than desktop, so mobile-first optimization helps you ensure people view your site correctly on phones and tablets. Web elements like pop-ups, image-heavy pages, and tiny text can make your site difficult to navigate on mobile.

Of course, generalizations aren‚Äôt always helpful, so check your analytics data to find out what percentage of your users and customers browse on mobile devices and understand how important mobile optimization is to your business.

If you're using Contentsquare, for example, your dashboard gives you a breakdown of your site users‚Äô devices.

6. Accessibility tools
An inclusive web experience isn‚Äôt optional‚Äîit‚Äôs a core part of UX. Accessibility-focused website optimization tools help you detect and fix issues that could prevent users with disabilities from navigating your site. Making your site accessible also contributes to better SEO and broader customer reach.

Bonus type 7: a classic optimization tactic not to neglect 

So far, we‚Äôve listed 30+ web optimization tools you can use right now to grow your website‚Äôs traffic and revenue. And there are thousands more where those came from. 

Whichever one you start with, don‚Äôt forget the one optimization tactic that‚Äôs so obvious that it‚Äôs chronically undervalued: speaking to your customers. 

While website optimization tools offer powerful data and insights, sometimes the best optimization tactic is the simplest: listening.

Even if you have the fastest website on the planet and rank high for your target keywords, no amount of speed or SEO ‚Äòbest practices‚Äô is a substitute for asking users directly how they feel from time to time‚Äîotherwise known as collecting voice-of-customer (VoC) insights. 

Try things like: 

Launching surveys to pop up on key pages, or at important moments in the customer journey 

Running 1-on-1 interviews to discuss pain points and moments of delight users experience on your site 

Conducting user tests to understand how users complete simple tasks on your site, and hear about any unexpected complications they experience  

Once you‚Äôve asked users what they expect from your website, and how they find the experience of navigating it, you can develop an optimization strategy that delivers exactly what they need.








What you can optimize: measure SEO performance, view keyword impressions and clicks, see your backlinks, and check for crawling and speed errors

How to use it: sign in with your Google account, verify site ownership, and wait for data to be collected

9. Optimize Your Channel Page

Organized the videos so that my best content appeared at the top:


________________________________________

10. Ask People to Subscribe
And NO don't just say "Make sure to subscribe to my channel" because nobody is gonna listen to that.

Here's what to do instead...

Say this "Subscribe and leave a comment saying 'I subscribed' and I'll personally reply 
to your comment"

If you do this and reply to just a few peoples' comments, other people will see this and 
subscribe. The videos you do this on will have the highest subscriber to view ration.

________________________________________

11. First, collaborate with other YouTubers, it can extremely expose your channel to the 
other YouTuber subscribers.

Second, use your other social media profiles and promote your YouTube channel there too.

Third, be consistent. Upload a video once a week. People love to see continuity. Also, 
make sure your video is a high-quilty one. Make sure you have a good light and your 
video have a clear sound, no one want to see a non-quilty video. Gaining subscribers 
on your own can take you a lot of time, so consider to buy YouTube subs. I can say that 
I used GetFans service and that it was extremely helpful for me. It made my channel to 
look more legit and helped me to gain more organic subscribers to my YouTube channel.

12. Use the Beta video upload mode.

Link your videos to each other.

Share the link of your videos on other social media.

Link your YouTube channel to other social media.

15. ü§¨ Comments appear to be an influential ranking factor. We found that a video‚Äôs 
comment count strongly correlates with higher rankings.

Longer videos significantly outperform shorter videos. The average length of a first 
page YouTube video is 14 minutes, 50 seconds.

We discovered that video views have a significant correlation with rankings.

The number of shares a video generates is strongly tied to first page YouTube rankings.

________________________________________

16. Write an enticing meta description.

Why It‚Äôs Important:  Although using keywords in your meta description isn‚Äôt a ranking 
factor anymore, organic click through rate is. And when Google searchers see a 
compelling meta description in the organic search results, they‚Äôre more likely to 
click on your site.

________________________________________

17. Make your site work with mobile devices. 

Why It‚Äôs Important: In other words, your site should be mobile-optimized for Google 
users and search engine crawlers. Google‚Äôs index is now ‚Äúmobile-first‚Äù, which makes 
mobile usability an absolute most for SEO.
________________________________________

18. My target keywords for this page are: SILUS GAMING WORLD &amp; SILUS SPIDER &amp; SILUS

________________________________________

19. Add your target keyword to your page‚Äôs URL. For example: mywebsite.com/my-keyword 
or mywebsite.com/my-keyword-guide

Why It‚Äôs Important: Google uses the terms in your URL to understand what your page is all about.
bauska.org/Silus
________________________________________

20. Use your keyword once at the top of your page (ideally in the first 50-100 words).

Why It‚Äôs Important: Search engines put more weight on terms that appear in prominent 
places on your page (like at the top).

________________________________________

21. Use your keyword in your page‚Äôs title tag. 

Why It‚Äôs Important: From a Google SEO point of view, your title tag is the most 
important place to include your keyword.

________________________________________

22. Use your keyword in an H1 and H2 Subheader.

Why It‚Äôs Important: This emphasizes to Google that your page is focused on that 
keyword and topic. H tags aren‚Äôt a huge deal for rankings. But every little bit helps. 

________________________________________

23. Use keyword-rich image filenames and alt text. 

Why It‚Äôs Important: Google uses images to understand the content of your page. And 
descriptive file names and alt text helps them understand what your page is all about.

________________________________________

24. Add internal links to other pages on your site. I recommend including at least 5 
internal links per page. 

Why It‚Äôs Important: Internal links can help Google find, crawl and index more pages on 
your site (and help them rank higher in the search results).

________________________________________

25. Add external links to other helpful websites and resources.

Why It‚Äôs Important: External linking to related pages helps Google figure out your 
page's topic. So I recommend adding lots of external links to pages that will help 
your users learn more about something that you cover on your page.

________________________________________

26. Use synonyms and related terms.

Why It‚Äôs Important: In other words: include variations of your target keyword on your 
page. For example, if your main keyword is ‚Äúkettlebell workout‚Äù, use variations like 
‚Äúkettlebell exercises‚Äù and ‚Äúeasy kettlebell movements‚Äù.

________________________________________

27. Use structured data. 

Why It‚Äôs Important: Structured data (Schema) can help your site feature ‚ÄúRich Snippets‚Äù 
in the search results.

________________________________________

28. Match search intent. Double check that your page is a 1:1 match for search intent. The 
best way to do that? Check out Google‚Äôs first page for that keyword. If they‚Äôre all a 
specific type of page (like a list post or ecommerce product page), you want your page to 
be in-line with what‚Äôs already ranking.

Why It‚Äôs Important: If your page doesn‚Äôt satisfy search intent, your page most likely will 
not rank for that keyword (even if you have lots of backlinks). It‚Äôs that important.

________________________________________

29. Decrease bounce rate. In other words: make your content ‚Äústicky‚Äù so that Google users 
stay on your page...and don‚Äôt bounce back to the search results. 

Why It‚Äôs Important: Bounce rate probably isn‚Äôt a direct Google ranking factor. But it 
might be. Especially if that bounce leads to ‚Äúpogosticking‚Äù.

________________________________________

30. Write a title tag that‚Äôs keyword optimized and engineered for clicks. The best way 
to do this is to think of what you would want to click on if you were searching for your 
target keyword.

Why It‚Äôs Important: Like I mentioned back in item #10 from this list, a high CTR can 
boost your rankings. And your title tag is a BIG factor in what people use to decide 
what to click on.

________________________________________

31. Use "Power Playlists" where the title of that playlist is an outcome: For example, 
"How to Get Higher Google Rankings".
