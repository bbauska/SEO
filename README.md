videos on each section of their platform. With this in mind, let's go over how the 
algorithm serves content via YouTube's six main user categories: Search, Home, Suggested

3. Use a Brand Watermark


________________________________________

4. Focus On Video Quality &amp; Consistency


________________________________________

5. Reply To Every Comment


________________________________________

6. Write a Compelling Channel Description


________________________________________

7. Identify the video that brought you the most subs last month:
(This video is your ‚ÄúSubscriber Magnet‚Äù.)

First, feature that video in your End Screen.

Second, make a playlist that starts off with that video.

Finally, promote that video in a card.

________________________________________

8. Promote Your Channel
blog post, podcast episode or Instagram

Social networks (like Facebook, Twitter and Reddit) want to promote native content on their platform.
Finally, include a link to your video as the first comment on the post.

Social Media: Share your videos on other social media platforms to reach a wider audience. 
Collaborations: Partner with other YouTubers in your niche to cross-promote each other's 
channels. 
Website/Blog Integration: Embed your YouTube videos on your website or blog to further 
promote your channel.

9. Optimize Your Channel Page

Organized the videos so that my best content appeared at the top:


________________________________________

10. Ask People to Subscribe
And NO don't just say "Make sure to subscribe to my channel" because nobody is gonna listen to that.

Here's what to do instead...

Say this "Subscribe and leave a comment saying 'I subscribed' and I'll personally reply 
to your comment"

If you do this and reply to just a few peoples' comments, other people will see this and 
subscribe. The videos you do this on will have the highest subscriber to view ration.

________________________________________

11. First, collaborate with other YouTubers, it can extremely expose your channel to the 
other YouTuber subscribers.

Second, use your other social media profiles and promote your YouTube channel there too.

Third, be consistent. Upload a video once a week. People love to see continuity. Also, 
make sure your video is a high-quilty one. Make sure you have a good light and your 
video have a clear sound, no one want to see a non-quilty video. Gaining subscribers 
on your own can take you a lot of time, so consider to buy YouTube subs. I can say that 
I used GetFans service and that it was extremely helpful for me. It made my channel to 
look more legit and helped me to gain more organic subscribers to my YouTube channel.

12. Use the Beta video upload mode.

Link your videos to each other.

Share the link of your videos on other social media.

Link your YouTube channel to other social media.

title so that people will like to click on your videos.

15. ü§¨ Comments appear to be an influential ranking factor. We found that a video‚Äôs 
comment count strongly correlates with higher rankings.

Longer videos significantly outperform shorter videos. The average length of a first 
page YouTube video is 14 minutes, 50 seconds.

We discovered that video views have a significant correlation with rankings.

The number of shares a video generates is strongly tied to first page YouTube rankings.

16. Write an enticing meta description.

Why It‚Äôs Important:  Although using keywords in your meta description isn‚Äôt a ranking 
factor anymore, organic click through rate is. And when Google searchers see a 
compelling meta description in the organic search results, they‚Äôre more likely to 
click on your site.

________________________________________

17. Make your site work with mobile devices. 

Why It‚Äôs Important: In other words, your site should be mobile-optimized for Google 
users and search engine crawlers. Google‚Äôs index is now ‚Äúmobile-first‚Äù, which makes 
mobile usability an absolute most for SEO.

18. My target keywords for this page are: SILUS GAMING WORLD &amp; SILUS SPIDER &amp; SILUS

________________________________________

19. Add your target keyword to your page‚Äôs URL. For example: mywebsite.com/my-keyword 
or mywebsite.com/my-keyword-guide

Why It‚Äôs Important: Google uses the terms in your URL to understand what your page is all about.

________________________________________

20. Use your keyword once at the top of your page (ideally in the first 50-100 words).

Why It‚Äôs Important: Search engines put more weight on terms that appear in prominent 
places on your page (like at the top).

________________________________________

21. Use your keyword in your page‚Äôs title tag. 

Why It‚Äôs Important: From a Google SEO point of view, your title tag is the most 
important place to include your keyword.

________________________________________

22. Use your keyword in an H1 and H2 Subheader.

Why It‚Äôs Important: This emphasizes to Google that your page is focused on that 
keyword and topic. H tags aren‚Äôt a huge deal for rankings. But every little bit helps. 

________________________________________

23. Use keyword-rich image filenames and alt text. 

Why It‚Äôs Important: Google uses images to understand the content of your page. And 
descriptive file names and alt text helps them understand what your page is all about.

________________________________________

24. Add internal links to other pages on your site. I recommend including at least 5 
internal links per page. 

Why It‚Äôs Important: Internal links can help Google find, crawl and index more pages on 
your site (and help them rank higher in the search results).

________________________________________

25. Add external links to other helpful websites and resources.

Why It‚Äôs Important: External linking to related pages helps Google figure out your 
page's topic. So I recommend adding lots of external links to pages that will help 
your users learn more about something that you cover on your page.

________________________________________

26. Use synonyms and related terms.

Why It‚Äôs Important: In other words: include variations of your target keyword on your 
page. For example, if your main keyword is ‚Äúkettlebell workout‚Äù, use variations like 
‚Äúkettlebell exercises‚Äù and ‚Äúeasy kettlebell movements‚Äù.

________________________________________

27. Use structured data. 

Why It‚Äôs Important: Structured data (Schema) can help your site feature ‚ÄúRich Snippets‚Äù 
in the search results.

________________________________________

28. Match search intent. Double check that your page is a 1:1 match for search intent. The 
best way to do that? Check out Google‚Äôs first page for that keyword. If they‚Äôre all a 
specific type of page (like a list post or ecommerce product page), you want your page to 
be in-line with what‚Äôs already ranking.

Why It‚Äôs Important: If your page doesn‚Äôt satisfy search intent, your page most likely will 
not rank for that keyword (even if you have lots of backlinks). It‚Äôs that important.

________________________________________

29. Decrease bounce rate. In other words: make your content ‚Äústicky‚Äù so that Google users 
stay on your page...and don‚Äôt bounce back to the search results. 

Why It‚Äôs Important: Bounce rate probably isn‚Äôt a direct Google ranking factor. But it 
might be. Especially if that bounce leads to ‚Äúpogosticking‚Äù.

________________________________________

30. Write a title tag that‚Äôs keyword optimized and engineered for clicks. The best way 
to do this is to think of what you would want to click on if you were searching for your 
target keyword.

Why It‚Äôs Important: Like I mentioned back in item #10 from this list, a high CTR can 
boost your rankings. And your title tag is a BIG factor in what people use to decide 
what to click on.

________________________________________

31. Use "Power Playlists" where the title of that playlist is an outcome: For example, 
"How to Get Higher Google Rankings".
